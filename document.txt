Local Service Marketplace
Create a platform where local service providers (plumbers, electricians, tutors) can list their services, and users can book them based on ratings and availability.

Key Features:

Service provider profiles with detailed service listings.
Customer reviews and ratings.
Booking system with calendar integration.
Secure payment gateway.

For a Local Service Marketplace project, here are some basic to intermediate features 

1. **User Authentication**: Allow users to register and log in as either service providers or customers.

2. **Service Provider Profile**: Service providers can create a profile with their name, contact information, service category (plumber, electrician, tutor, etc.), and a brief description of their services.

3. **Service Listings**: Service providers can create listings for their services, including details such as service description, pricing, availability, and service area.

4. **Search and Filter**: Implement a search functionality where users can search for services based on location, service category, and availability. Provide filters to narrow down search results.

5. **Booking System**: Users can book services based on the availability shown by the service providers. Implement a calendar or availability scheduler for service providers to manage their schedules.

6. **Reviews and Ratings**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for service providers based on their experience. Display average ratings on service provider profiles.

7. **Messaging System**: Implement a messaging system to allow communication between service providers and customers regarding service details, availability, and any other inquiries.

8. **Notifications**: Send notifications to users regarding booking confirmation, service updates, and other relevant information.

9. **Payment Integration**: Integrate a payment gateway to allow users to pay for services online. Ensure the platform is secure and complies with relevant regulations.

10. **Admin Panel**: Create an admin panel to manage user accounts, service listings, reviews, and other aspects of the platform.

11. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the platform is responsive and works well on mobile devices, as many users may access it from smartphones or tablets.
